# Summary

Screwdriver bits for standard hex 1/4" screwdriver handle. They come in four flavors, Phillips (cross head, roughly #2 size) and slot drive (5 mm), both in 20 mm and 50 mm length. They print (and work - well until you decide to apply a little too much torque) surprisingly well. Printed in dark gray they are hard to distinguish from their metal counterpart. 

Here a handle, if you need one:

For me this has mainly been an experiment in how far you can go with PLA. Turns out they will not be the replacement for the shiny, hardened steel screwdriver bit set you had recently seen in the window of your favorite hardware store (and decided to put on your wish list for next Xmas), but they could come handy in environments where you need (very) little torque and where (for whatever reason) metal is not an option (like adjusting that hard to reach potentiometer head...). 

They print well standing upright, but (at least for the 50 mm variety) you will need some kind of build plate adhesion (I use 3 mm brims). Use minimum layer height, 100% infill and print as slow as possible (I use 30 mm/s for the shafts, but only 10 mm/s for the tips). On my printer they turn out nicer when I print 2 at the same time (seems to be a temperature issue).

Have fun!
